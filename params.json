Once you have j2objc-gradle projects,\r\nyou can hook them up to your Xcode builds too - which was indeed the original author's\r\nuse of this plugin.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nFind the proper syntax for applying the plugin on [the mixc-build page at plugins.gradle.org](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.madvay.tools.build.mixc).\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\napply plugin: 'com.madvay.tools.build.mixc'\r\n\r\nmodel {\r\n    mixc {\r\n        j2objcProject ':common1'\r\n        j2objcProject ':common2'\r\n\r\n        nativeProject ':native-objc1'\r\n        nativeProject ':native-cpp2'\r\n\r\n        // Uncomment if you don't want release flavors built every time.\r\n        // (debug and release are enabled by default).\r\n        // releaseEnabled = false\r\n        debugEnabled = true\r\n\r\n        xcodeProject 'ios', {\r\n            // Do NOT put the Gradle project and the Xcode project in the same directory./\r\n            // The build/ subdirectories will conflict.\r\n            dir = file('../app-ios')\r\n            projectName = 'app-ios'\r\n            // Will not run tests by default.\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        xcodeProject 'osx', {\r\n            dir = file('../app-mac')\r\n            projectName = 'app-mac'\r\n            sdk = 'macosx'\r\n            // Will also run this target for unit tests.\r\n            testTarget = 'app-macUnitTests'\r\n            // Will depend on the 'ios' build above.\r\n            dependsOnXcodeProject 'ios'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create tasks such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nxcodePreBuildDebug\r\nxcodePreBuildRelease\r\nxcodePreBuild\r\n\r\nxcodeIosBuildDebug\r\nxcodeIosBuildRelease\r\nxcodeIosArchiveRelease\r\nxcodeIosExportRelease\r\n\r\nxcodeIosCleanDebug\r\nxcodeIosCleanRelease\r\n\r\nxcodeOsxBuildDebug\r\nxcodeOsxBuildRelease\r\nxcodeOsxArchiveRelease\r\nxcodeOsxExportRelease\r\n\r\nxcodeOsxCleanDebug\r\nxcodeOsxCleanRelease\r\n\r\nxcodeOsxTestDebug\r\nxcodeOsxTestRelease\r\n\r\nxcodeArchive\r\nxcodeExport\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build tasks are made children of `assemble`, the clean tasks of `clean`,\r\nand the test tasks of `check`.  The archive and export (of release flavors\r\nonly) are outside of the normal task tree; run `xcodeExport` to get .pkg\r\nand .ipa (for OS X and iOS respectively) exports in your projects' exports/\r\ndirectories.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- Gradle 2.5 or higher\r\n- Mac computer, with Mac OS X 10.10 or higher\r\n- Xcode 6 or higher\r\n- If using j2objc-gradle, v0.3.0-alpha or higher\r\n\r\n## License\r\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/madvay/mixc-build/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\nSee also the [NOTICE](https://github.com/madvay/mixc-build/blob/master/NOTICE) file, per section 4 d of the License.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 by Advay Mengle.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this software except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
